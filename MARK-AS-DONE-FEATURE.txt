                    "MARK AS DONE" FEATURE - DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

A new feature has been added that allows you to mark themes as completed in
the admin panel. Completed themes appear greyed out with strikethrough on
both the admin panel and the main voting page.

================================================================================
HOW TO USE (ADMIN PANEL)
================================================================================

1. Go to your admin panel:
   http://localhost:3000/admin/a7f3e9b2-4d8c-4a1e-9f6b-3c7d2e8a5b4f
   (or your Vercel deployment URL)

2. Find the theme you want to mark as done

3. Check the "Done" checkbox next to the theme

4. The theme will immediately:
   - Show strikethrough text
   - Display [DONE] badge
   - Appear greyed out (50% opacity)
   - Disable voting on the main site

5. To mark it as incomplete again:
   - Simply uncheck the "Done" checkbox

================================================================================
HOW IT APPEARS ON MAIN WEBSITE
================================================================================

When a theme is marked as done:

✓ Theme text appears with strikethrough
✓ "[DONE]" badge is shown in Courier New font
✓ Entire theme card is greyed out (50% opacity)
✓ Upvote button is disabled (can't vote on completed themes)
✓ Theme still visible but clearly marked as resolved

Example:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dark Mode Support [DONE]              ▲             │
│ 2h ago                                 45            │
│ (with strikethrough and greyed out)                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

- 0 = not completed (default)
- 1 = completed/done

API Endpoint Added:
- PATCH /api/admin/themes/:id/toggle-complete
- Requires admin authentication

================================================================================
BENEFITS
================================================================================

1. Visual feedback that a theme has been implemented
2. Keeps theme in the list for reference
3. Prevents people from continuing to vote on completed items
4. Clear communication to users about what's been done
5. Maintains voting history (votes are preserved)

================================================================================
DEPLOYING TO VERCEL
================================================================================

The changes have been pushed to GitHub. To deploy:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Your project should auto-deploy from the latest commit
3. Or manually redeploy from the Deployments tab

If you're using SQLite locally:
- Delete your themes.db file to recreate with the new schema
- Or it will auto-add the "completed" column on next run

If you're using Vercel KV:
- No action needed! It will automatically work with the new field
